   to develop the software/application.
   
   
 what types of applications we have available in the market?
 
    
    ->desktop application
	->distributed application 
	
	
 using java, what type of applications we can develop?
    
	both types 
	
 
 java -> 1995 -> james gosling
 
   ->sun microsystem
   
   
 
 ->jse-java standard edition(core java)

  structure of java program:
  
  
  note: we should not question the syntaxes
  
  syntax: it is a rule which is given by language vendor 
  
  as a programmer we have to follow otherwise we will get the errors.
  
  
  class <classname>
  {
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
     System.out.pritln("welcome to java sessions");
   }//closing main method
   
  }//class closing
  
 
 what do you mean by compiling the java program?
 
 as a programmer we have to follow syntaxes.
 
 whether syntactially programmer follows correctly or not? 
 java compiler will check that
 
 
   compile time errors.
   
   compiler 
   
   only programmer wheenver he made mistakes syntactically then only 
   java compiler gave those errors.
   
   java compiler ?
   
    java compiler is the system defined java program which is running in the background.
	
	C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_221\bin
	
 
 
 how can we compile this java program?
 `````````````````````````````````````
 
   syntax:  javac <filename>.java
   
            javac Test.java
			
   
how can we execute the java program:
`````````````````````````````````````

syntax:  java <classname>


         java Demo
		 
		 


 note:
 while we are compiling the java program we should always gives filename
 while we are executing/running the java program we should always 
 gives classname.
 
 note: can we give both filename and class name are same?
 
  yes
  
example:
``````````
class Demo
{

   public static void main(String[] args)
{
  //logic
   System.out.println("welcome to java sessions");
}
   
}


 
 
structure of java program 

 we wrote the program 

  .java

filename.java

compile 
execute

path:
`````
path is the location where java predefined tools are available.


C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19\bin

location where all the java tools are available like 
javac,javap,javadoc,java etc..


operating system couldn't recognize these predefined tools 

to make it this as recognizable application, what we have to do?

we have to set the path 

why should we set the path?

 by default os couldn't recognize java commands, to make it recognize
 by os we have to set the path(where all java tools are available)
 
how can we set the path?

we do have two ways are there to set the path


 1.temporarily
 2.permanently

set path ="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19\bin" 

note:
once we set the path temporarily, till you close the command prompt 
we can use all the java tools once you close it that session gets closed
again you will get error.


how to set the path permanently in java:
``````````````````````````````````````````
->click on start button

->click on edit the system environment variables

->click on environment variables button

->click on new button which is related to uservariables tab

->give the vairable name: path
           viariable value: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19\bin
		   
		   
->click on ok(3 times)

 
 if you specify a path as  value for a system variable, that path 
 should be accessible to all user accounts.
 
 if you set the path only in user variable , it will be effected only 
 to that particular user itself.
 
 
 
 compiling the java program?
 
  javac <filename>.java
  
  who will compile this java program?
   java compiler 
   
   what is java compiler? 
   it is a system defined java program 
   
   
 java compiler will cross check all the syntactical mistakes,
 if programmer will not make any syntactical mistakes what java compiler will do?
 
 
    java compiler will generate .class file from .java file
	
	.java file ->source code -> developed by java programmer
	
	.class file -> byte code -> generated by java compiler.
	
what is byte code:
`````````````````
byte code can be defined as intermediate code generated by the compiler
after the compilation of source code(java program).

******
this intermediate code makes java a platform independent language.
*******

  .c 
  .exe
  windows

  unix operating system 
  
    .exe file in his unix os?
	c programming language -> platform dependent programming language
	
	
	java is platform independent programming language
	
	irrespective of any os. we are  allowed to run this .class file 
	
	to convert from one o.s -> other o.s
	
	
.class file generated based on the class name not based on the filename


.class file code is not human readable code.

who can read or who can understand this code?

 

 answer: jvm(java virtual machine)
 
 
	
 jre->it is providing runtime environment
 
 jvm 
 
 java compiler input : file (.java)
 
 how can we run this program:
 ``````````````````````````````
 what jvm internally did?
 
   jvm input -> class name(byte code)
   
  jvm converts byte code into machinelevel code(binary code)

  
 cd-> change the directory
 
 to move to particular directory

 data is getting stored inside an object
 Garbage collector:
 it is the system defined java program 
 which is running periodically 
 for the purpose of collecting unused memory spaces
 
 
 
why java is simple?

->syntax is based on c++
->java has removed some complex concepts such as explicit pointers,
  operator overloading
->There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because 
  there is an automatic garbage collection in java.
->java syntaxes are very userfriendly.

java is platform independent:
```````````````````````````````
 
  wora ->write once run/reuse  anywhere
  
  irrespective of any o.s we are allowed to execute java programs.

Robust:
````````
 strong
 java is strong 
 
 because in postivie scenario
 
 and asweel as in negative scenario
   
   

   
 ->it uses strong memory management
 ->there is lack of pointer that avoids security problems
 ->java provides automatic garbage collection wich runs on the jvm to 
   get rid of objects which are not being used by a java application 
   any more.
 ->There are exception handling and the type checking mechanism in jaa.
 
 
   any syntatical errors -> compile time errors
   logically if you do any mistakes -> at runtime by the jvm
   
     runtime errors ->exceptions

multithreaded:
````````````````

multiple threads

thread:
separate progam executing parallely.

1 programmer -> 20 days

20 programmers -> 1 day

we can write java programs that deal with many tasks at once 
by defining multiple threads.

the main advantage of multi threading is that it doesn't occupy memory 
for each thread.
it shares a  common memory area.

threads are important for multimideia , web applications etc.



dynamic:
````````
it supports the dynamic loading of classes.

java is object oriented programming language

 because it follows oops principles
 
    inheritance
	polymorphism
	abstraction
	encapuslation
	  -omg organization 
	  
	in java language, how can we achieve the above principles?

by using these two concepts
	class 
	object 
	
note:
every java program should starts with by defining the class.

	
class:
``````
class is a collection of 

 -variables
 -methods into a single unit.
 
 
main() is mandatory to execute the java program 
because java execution starts from main() only.

jvm will internally call this main()

note:

without main() we can compile the java program but we can't execute 
the java program 
 since java execution / jvm internally calls the main() when you 
 execute the java program.
 
 
variables:
``````````
 100 in some specified user defined name
 inetrnally java will allocate some address (system defined address)
 
 
   it is highly recommended to store the data in our own variable names
   
   we can easily access whenever you want.
   
   readability will be improved.
   
   
 purpose of variable:

    to store the data.

  stid =100;//valid or invalid


  
 java is strongly typed programming language
 
  we have to specify the datatype.
  
  datatype:
  
   what type of data we are storing we should specify that type 
   while we are storing the data.
   
   int stid = 100;
   
   
syntax of varialbe declaration:

   <datatypename> <variablename> = <value>;

java is case sensitive programming language
we have to take care about upper case and lower case variables.


 rules to declare the variable name:
``````````````````````````````````````
1.variable name should always starts with alphabet 
  it should not start with numeric 

2.no special characters are allowed except $ and _(underscore)  

3.we are not allowed to use varaible names as java reserved words.

4.variable names are case sensitive.

5.blank spaces are not allowed while we are declaring the variables.


<datatypename> <variablename> = <value>;

different datatypes are available in java.



   4 categories of datatypes 
   
   1. integer
   
   2. characters
   
   3.float category
   
   4.boolean category
   

integer category datatypes:
```````````````````````````

  are used to store numeric values.
  
  we have 4 different integer datatypes are availble in java
  
  1.byte  -> 1 byte ->  8  bits
  2.short -> 2 bytes -> 16 bits
  3.int   -> 4 bytes -> 32 bits
  4.long  -> 8 bytes -> 64 bits
  
the above datatypes are predefined datatypes /prmitive datatypes
which are given by sunmicrosystem


note:
`````
A primitive type is predefined by the language and is named by a reserved keyword.

note:

all the java reserved keywords must be always in lower case only.

 
 
note:
every datatype is maintaining two things


 1.range
 
 2.memory size
 
 based on the value or range of data we are storing we are selecting 
 the corresponding datatype.
 
 
byte b = 100

to calculate any datatype range i have one formula

 -2^n-1 to (2^n-1) - 1
 where n -> no.of bits occupied by the datatype
 
 range of the byte datatype.
 
 byte -> 1 byte - > 8 bits
 
 -2^7 to (2^7) -1
 
 -128 to 127
 is the range of the byte datatype.
 
 byte b =128;
 
character category:
````````````````````
to store single character we have to use character category data.
note:
to store single character it is mandatory to store with in single quotes.

note: char is the datatype 
memory size: 2 bytes of memory 

because java internally follows unicode 
java supports 18 international languages

java is object oriented programming language
 
  ->since it follows oops principles which are given by omg 
  organization .
  
  1.inheritance
  2.polymorphism
  3.abstraction
  4.encapuslation
  
  
to achieve above principles we are using two concepts in java
 1. class
 2. object
 
 
class:
``````
class is a collectio of variables and methods into a single unit. 
that single unit is known as class. 


every java program should starts with by defining the class only.

 class <classname>
 {
  //vairables
   
   //methods
  
 }
 
java doesn't support non member variables and non member methods

 


variable:

  variable is used to store the data
  
  <datatypename> <variablename> = <value>;
  
  int stid = 100;
  

class is 

  -variables
  -methods
  

method:
``````
method is the place where we are writing the logic
to perform some operation based on the requirement.

note
if you want to define your own logic , define your own method.


syntax
```````
[accessmodifier] <returntype> <methodname>([if any parameters])
{
  
   //logic
}


ex:

  public void display()
  {
   System.out.println("iam from display");
   }
   
 if a method is not returning any value to represent that we are using one return type i.e void 


int getAge()
{
return 23;
} 

if a method is returning any value, using return keyword we are allowed to return the value.

note:
return type and return value must be compatible with each other





public void sum(int x, int y)
{
System.out.println(x+y);
}



  sum(4,5);
  
  
public int sum(int x, int y)
{
return x+y;
}


->define the method which returns name of the student?


  String getStudentName()
  {
    return "rama";
  }

->define the method whcih returns age of the student?


  public int getStudentAge()
  {
  return 78;
  }


->define the method which takes two integer parameters and return the sum value?

int getSum(int x,int y)
{
return x+y
}

->define the method which takes two string parameters and gives 
concatination of the string?


  String getConcatination(String x, String y)
  {
   return x+y;
   }
   
getConcatination("rama","krishna");

ramakrishna

example:
`````````
class Student
{
  //variable declaration 
   static int stid=100;
   static String stname ="Rama";
   
   //method definition 
   public static void display()
   {
     System.out.println(stid);
	 System.out.println(stname);
	 
	 
   }
   
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
	   //calling display()
	   display();
	   
   }

}

example on Employee class:
````````````````````````````
/*define the class Employee which declares empid and empname and display their details?*/



class Employee
{
 static int empId =100;
 static String empName="manikbasha";
 //define the method
 
 public static void getDetails()
 { 
 System.out.println(empId);
 System.out.println(empName);
 }
 public static void main(String[] arg)
 {
 getDetails();
 } 
 }
 

class is a collection of 


 -variables
 -& methods into a single unit.

 
java is object oriented programming language
  -> class
  
     
	 
  -> object
  
  
  
  when we define a class, there is no memory space created
  for the properties which we are declaring inside the class.
  
  
object:
``````
instance of a class is known as object.

instance:
````````
allocating suffficeint amount of memory space for the 
properties of the class.

for a single class, how many objects we can create?

  as many as we want based on the requirement
  
  
 how can we create the object :
 
 
 syntax:
 
 <classname> <objectname> = new <classname>();
 
 
  Student obj = new Student();
  
  Student -> name of the class 
  obj -> object name
  = -> assignment operator
  new ->dynamic memory allocation operator
  Student() -> constructor 
  

  the object for Employee
  

->define Account class with variables accountId,accountName
  and display their details by using object?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  hpw to define the class
  how to create the object
  
  class-
   collection of 
    variables and methods into a single unit.
	
	object
	 -instance of a class is known as object
	 -allocating sufficient amount of memeory space for the 
	  properties of the class.
	  
	  
  jvm 
  
java program execution starts from main() 
who will call main();
  
   jvm will call this main()
   

note:
using object, we can access the properties and as well as 
we can update the values based on the requirement.

example:
``````````
class Product
{
 int productId = 100;
 String productName ="soap";
 
 public void getProductDetails()
 {
   System.out.println("Product id: " + productId);
   System.out.println("Product Name: " + productName);
   
 }
 
 public static void main(String[] args)
 {
	 //create the object for my class (Product)
	 Product p = new Product();
	 
	 //using object we are chanigng the values
	 p.productId=101;
	 p.productName="laptop";
	 
	 p.getProductDetails();
	 
	 
 }
 
}
  
  





define Student class with stid, stname and update the values 
with your own name using object?



we can create multiple objects for a single class, where each object is having their own address.

example:
````````
class Product
{
 int productId = 100;
 String productName ="soap";
 
 public void getProductDetails()
 {
   System.out.println("Product id: " + productId);
   System.out.println("Product Name: " + productName);
   
 }
 
 public static void main(String[] args)
 {
	 //create the object for my class (Product)
	 Product p1 = new Product();

College 
 
  1000 students 
  
     1 object is not enough to store 1000 students information 
	 1000 objects are required
	 


note:
`````

object name is always must be unique, you can't declare multiple 
objects with the same name.

example:
`````````
class Employee
{
	
	//variables
   int empId=100;
    String empName="rama";
   double empSalary=9878.87;
   
   //method 
   public  void getEmpDetails()
   {
	   System.out.println("====================");
    System.out.println("employee id  is: " + empId);
	System.out.println("employee name is : " + empName);
	System.out.println("employee salary is: " + empSalary);
   }

  //main method
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
     
	//create the object for the Employee class
	Employee obj1 = new Employee();
	 
	//create the object for the Employee class
	Employee obj2 = new Employee();
	
	System.out.println(obj1);
	System.out.println(obj2);
}
}

using object name, i want to change the values?

is it possible or not?



yes it is possible, please observe below program 


class Employee
{
	
	//variables
   int empId=100;
    String empName="rama";
   double empSalary=9878.87;
   
   //method 
   public  void getEmpDetails()
   {
	   System.out.println("====================");
    System.out.println("employee id  is: " + empId);
	System.out.println("employee name is : " + empName);
	System.out.println("employee salary is: " + empSalary);
   }

  //main method
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
     
	//create the object for the Employee class
	Employee obj1 = new Employee();
	 
	//change the values using object name
	
	obj1.empId=101;
	obj1.empName="manik";
	obj1.empSalary=8989.99;
	
	//call the method
	obj1.getEmpDetails();
 
   }
}

instance(non static) vs static:
`````````````````````````````````


 int a;//a is non static variable 
 
 static int a;//a is static variable 
 
 
 public void m1()//non static method or instance method
 {
 //instance area
 }
 
 public static void m1()//static method 
 {
    //static area
 }
 
 by default main method is static or non static?
 
 
the area which belongs to non-static method is known 
as non-static area or instance area

the area which belongs to static method is known as static area.

 
by default main method area is also static area 


note1:
``````
from static area, to access non-static properties using object name  we can access

note2:
``````
from static area or non-static area, to access static properties using 
below way we can access

1.directly we can access
2.using classname we can access


note:
``````
whenever we create the object, memory locations will be created for 
non-static or instance properties not for static properties.


q?
when should we declare any property as static property?

answer: if a property is common to all , then go and declare that 
property as static 

once we declare any property as static , then memory will be created 
only once by the classloader subsystem
it is the sub part of jvm.


example:
````````
class Employee
{
	
	//non-static variables
   int empId=100;
   String empName="rama";
   double empSalary=9878.87;
   
   //static property 
   static String companyName="infosys";
   
   //instance method or non-static method 
   public void getEmployeeDetails()
   {
	   //instance area
	   
	   System.out.println("-------------------");
	   System.out.println("employee id : " + empId);
	   System.out.println("employee name: " + empName);
	   System.out.println("employee salary: " + empSalary);
	   System.out.println("employee company name:  " + companyName);
	   
	   
   }
   
  //main method
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
     //static area
	 Employee obj = new Employee();
	 System.out.println("employee id: " + obj.empId);
	 System.out.println("employee name: " + obj.empName);
	 System.out.println("employee salary:" + obj.empSalary);
	 
	 System.out.println("employee company name: " +companyName);
	 
	 companyName="TCS";
	 
	 System.out.println("employee company name: " +Employee.companyName);
	 
	 //call the method using obect name 
	 
	 obj.getEmployeeDetails();
 
   }
}
